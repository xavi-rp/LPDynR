Description: It uses 'phenological' and productivity-related variables derived from time series of Normalized 
    Difference Vegetation Index to assess ecosystem dynamics and change, which eventually might drive to 
    land degradation. The final result of the Land Productivity Dynamics indicator is a categorical map 
    with 5 classes of land productivity dynamics, ranging from declining to increasing productivity.

Description: It uses 'phenological' and productivity-related variables derived from time series of vegetation 
    indexes, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, to assess ecosystem dynamics and change, which 
    eventually might drive to land degradation. The final result of the Land Productivity Dynamics indicator 
    is a categorical map with 5 classes of land productivity dynamics, ranging from declining to increasing 
    productivity. See <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X21010517/> for a description of the methods used in 
    the package to calculate the indicator.

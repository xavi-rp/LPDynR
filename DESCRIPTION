Description: It uses phenological and productivity-related variables derived from time series of NDVI 
    to assess ecosystem dynamics and change, which eventually might drive to land degradation. The final 
    result of the LPD indicator is a categorical map with 6 classes of land productivity dynamics, ranging 
    from declining to strongly increasing productivity.
